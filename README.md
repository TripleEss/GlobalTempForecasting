# GlobalTempForecasting
The purpose of this project was to predict future temperatures for different cities based on geographic location and concentrations of atmospheric pollutants.

- Three different data sets were used:
  1. Earth surface temperature data, containing daily temperature recordings for cities across the globe from the mid-1700s to the present. See https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data.
  2. Atmospheric pollutant concentrations, containing annual levels of certain contaminants for the past 2000 years (data obtained from ice core samples). See ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/
paleo/icecore/antarctica/law/law2006.txt
  3. Human population, containing global annual human population. From UN report.
